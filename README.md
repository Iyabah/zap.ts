# Zap.ts ⚡

**Zap.ts** – named after ⚡️ – is a Next.js boilerplate designed to help you build applications faster using a modern set of tools.

## Installation ⚡

You can create a new Zap.ts project using your preferred package manager:

```sh
npx create-zap-app@latest
```

## Check The Docs ⚡

You will find all you need to get started by reading the [documentation](https://zap-ts.alexandretrotel.org).

## How It Works ⚡

Zap.ts is fast to set up and very easy to use. It comes with clear documentation and a carefully selected set of tools that make the developer experience (DX) modern and enjoyable.

## Why It Exists ⚡

Starting a new web project always means repeating steps: setting up a database, adding login features, installing tools, handling payments, and creating email systems. A ready-made solution saves time and lets the focus stay on making something useful, not on setup. It gives one easy way to do things, improving the coding experience (DX). This means no need to worry about how it all works inside—just like shadcn/ui keeps things simple.

## Startups Love It ⚡

Startups move fast and need tools that keep up. Zap.ts is built with startups in mind, offering a launchpad to go from idea to product in record time. Here’s why it’s a game-changer for your team:

- **Speed to Market**: Pre-configured tools and seamless integrations mean you skip the setup grind and start building your MVP right away.
- **Cost-Effective**: No need to reinvent the wheel or hire specialists for boilerplate tasks – Zap.ts gives you a production-ready stack for free.
- **Scalability**: From prototype to scale, the modern libraries (like Drizzle and oRPC) ensure your app grows without breaking.
- **Focus on Innovation**: Spend your energy on what makes your startup unique, not on plumbing. Authentication, UI, and APIs are ready out of the box.
- **Future-Proof**: With flexible tools like better-auth and the AI Vercel SDK, you can adapt to new requirements or tech trends without a full rewrite.

Whether you’re a solo founder or a small team, Zap.ts empowers you to ship fast, iterate often, and compete with the big players.

## Tools Included ⚡

Zap.ts includes these libraries:

- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/): The best way to get ready-to-use UI components that you can customize however you like.

- [drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/): An ORM that lets you write database schemas in TypeScript, sync them with your database, and is easy to use. It’s set up with [Neon](https://neon.tech/) by default, but you can switch databases easily.
- [zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/): A lightweight alternative to Redux and React Context. It helps you write less code, do more, and supports local storage persistence out of the box.
- [oRPC](https://orpc.unnoq.com/): An alternative to tRPC that supports OpenAPI specs, making it easy to build type-safe APIs for frontend and backend.
- [AI Vercel SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/): A toolkit for streaming text, handling objects, using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and more. It lets you switch between providers without depending on a specific SDK.
- And more...
