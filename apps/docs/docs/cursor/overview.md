# Overview

[**Cursor**](https://www.cursor.com/) is an AI-powered IDE designed to help developers build *faster* by enhancing their workflow.

It offers features like [Rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules) and [MCPs](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol) to streamline coding.

In this section, we’ll explain what these features are and how **Zap.ts ⚡️** integrates with **Cursor** to boost your development experience.

However, we strongly recommend reviewing all AI-generated code carefully and avoiding blind _“vibe coding”_.

While **Zap.ts** provides a framework and best practices to guide LLMs, understanding your code remains essential.
