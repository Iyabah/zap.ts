# Deployment

Zap.ts is built on **Next.js**, which means you can leverage the full ecosystem of **Next.js** deployment options.

To deploy Zap.ts, refer to the [official Next.js deployment guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/deploying).

It explains how to deploy a **Next.js** app to platforms like [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and more.

## Docker

For [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), we already included a `Dockerfile` and a `.dockerignore` file that you can customize how you like.

They were made following the Next.js recommandation from the above documentation.
