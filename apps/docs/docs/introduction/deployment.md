# Deployment

Zap.ts is built on **Next.js**, which means you can leverage the full ecosystem of Next.js deployment options.

To deploy Zap.ts, refer to the [official Next.js deployment guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/deploying).

This documentation explain how to deploy a Next.js app to platforms like Digital Ocean, Docker, and more.
